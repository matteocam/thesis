\chapter*{Acknowledgments}


This is one of the most important sections in a dissertation. In fact, although one's technical contributions may be modest or become obsolete soon after the time of writing, the acts by and the interactions with the people mentioned here are the real timeless stuff. G.H. Hardy would have disagreed, but that's another matter.

First, a special thanks to my advisor Rosario Gennaro. Thanks for many things, but especially for one. It is a hard search problem that of finding the intersection of what we can solve and what is interesting to us. Rosario constantly made an effort to give me the time,  the space and the travel stipends (an often overlooked complexity measure) to eventually encounter some progress on it. 

Thanks to the people that, directly or not, acted as mentors and teachers: Amotz Bar-Noy, Nelly Fazio, Dario Fiore, Leonid Gurvits, Tancr\`ede Lepoint, Jesper Buus Nielsen, William Skeith, Noson Yanofsky. Noson taught the computational complexity course in my first term as a Ph.D. student. I owe to this course a stretch in my interests of geological proportions. My friends and colleagues, Kelly Eckenrode and Alessio Sammartano, offered meta-technical support and precious conversations throughout my Ph.D.; thank you for being an inspiration.

The work in this thesis would not have been possible without the interaction with so many people. My thanks go: to Marios Georgiou, for stretching my mind at every opportunity and tolerating my research-related phone calls at uncomfortable times of the day;
to my colleagues at CCNY, Bertrand Ithurburn, Sima Jafarikhah, Nihal Vatandas, for the good chats and a great lab atmosphere; 
to my coauthors Steven Goldfeder and Luca Nizzardo, for their dedication and for making it fun. 

I am deeply indebted to my parents, Domenico and Rita, for their unconditional love and support. I want to thank Nigel Deans and Annika Karinen; that little passion for science I may have, I virtually owe it all to you. I am indebted to $\cal{L}$, for being an outstanding listener and for telling me about The Rest. 

Finally, thanks to Itai Feigenbaum and Mariana Raykova for being part of my committee, and to the indispensable support of the City College of New York through the Robert Kahn Fellowship and the NSF through grant 1545759.
