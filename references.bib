No assumption about her computing power is made. The scenario assumes that a random bit string of length slightly larger than the adversary's memory capacity can be received by all parties. The random bit string can for instance be broadcast by a satellite or over an optical network, or transmitted over an insecure channel between the communicating parties. The proposed schemes require very high bandwidth but can nevertheless be practical.},
