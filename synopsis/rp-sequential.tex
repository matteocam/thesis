\section{Sequential Composition}
We now present the main results of our work. First we informally describe our notion of sequential composition of 
rational proof, via a motivating example and show that the protocols in \cite{am,am1,rosen} do not satisfy it. Then we present our definition of sequential rational proofs, and a protocol that achieves it for circuits of bounded depth.

\section{Results for FFT circuits}

In this section we apply the previous results to the problem of computing FFT circuits, and by extension to polynomial evaluations.
