The above counterexample motivates the following Definition which formalizes 
that the reward of the honest prover $P$ must always be larger than the total 
reward of any prover $\disP$ that invests less computation cost than $P$. 

Technically this is not trivial to do, since it is not possible to claim the above for {\em any} prover $\disP$ and {\em any} sequence of inputs, because it
is possible that for a given input $\tilde{x}$, the prover $\disP$ has "hardwired" the correct value $\tilde{y}=f(\tilde{x})$ and can compute it without investing 
any work. We therefore propose a definition that holds for inputs randomly chosen according to a given probability distribution $\cal D$, and we allow for
the possibility that the reward of a dishonest prover can be "negligibly" larger than the reward of the honest prover (for example if $\disP$ is lucky and such 
"hardwired" inputs are selected by $\cal D$).

\begin{definition}[Sequential Rational Proof]
	\label{def:SRP}
	A rational proof $(P,V)$ for a function $f:$ $\bit^n$ $\to$ 
	$\bit^n$ is $(\epsilon, K)$-{\sf sequentially composable} for an input distribution $\cal D$, if for every prover $\disP$, 
	for a sequence of inputs 
	$x,x_1,\ldots,x_k$ drawn according to ${\cal D}$ such that $C(x) \geq \sum_{i=1}^k 
	\tilde{C}(x_i)$ and $k \leq K$ we have that $\sum_{i}\tilde{R}(x_i) - R \leq \epsilon$.
\end{definition}

% Some properties of Sequential Rational Proofs
\noindent
A few sufficient conditions for sequential composability follow.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:cost-rew-ratios}
% Rew ratio ineq. implies SRP
Let $(P,V)$ be a rational proof.
If for every input $x$  it holds that $R(x)=R$ and  $C(x)=C$ for constants 
$R \mbox{ and } C$, and the 
following inequality holds for every 
$\disP\neq 
P$ and input $x\in {\cal D}$:
\[ \frac{\tilde{R}(x)}{R} \leq \frac{\tilde{C}(x)}{C} + \epsilon\]
then $(P,V)$ is $(KR\epsilon, K)$-sequentially composable for $\cal D$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
It suffices to observe that, for any $k$ inputs $x_1,...,x_k$, the inequality 
above 
implies
\begin{align*}
\sum_{i=1}^{k}\tilde{R}(x_i)  \leq R [\sum_{i=1}^{k} (\frac{\tilde{C}(x_i)}{C}  + \epsilon) ] 
\leq R +kR\epsilon
\end{align*}
where the last inequality holds whenever $\sum_{i=1}^{k} \tilde{C}(x_i) \leq C$ 
as 
in Definition \ref{def:SRP}.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
	\label{cor:prob}
	Let $(P,V)$ and $\rew$ be respectively an interactive proof and a reward 
	function as in 
	Definition \ref{def:RP}; if $\rew$ can only assume the values $0$ and $R$ for 
	some constant $R$, let $\pDisR = \Pr[\rew((\disP,V)(x)) = R]$. If for $x \in {\cal D}$
	$$  \pDisR \leq \frac{\tilde{C}(x)}{C} + \epsilon $$
	then $(P,V)$ is $(KR\epsilon, K)$-sequentially composable for $\cal D$. 
	% If rew can be only R or 0 then the sufficient condition is on the probability
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
Observe that $\tilde{R}(x) = \pDisR\cdot R$ and then apply Lemma 
\ref{lemma:cost-rew-ratios}.
\end{proof}
